## Notes to the template: Type levels and bullets

The standard text area has five predefined type levels.

You can move up or down the levels using the increase or decrease indent
buttons in the home tab.

We recommend that you do not use the bullet button, as this does not
apply the correct bullet formatting.

Level one is for general text

Level two is for subheadings within body copy

-   Level three is for intro text
-   Level four is the first level of bullets
    -   Level five is the second level of bullets
